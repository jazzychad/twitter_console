ABOUT:
    'twitter_console' is a twitter streaming client using the newly released User Streams with are in pre-alpha. Stuff make break.
    It is written in PHP. Want a ruby client? Port it yourself or use @rk's http://github.com/ryanking/earlybird instead.

INSTRUCTIONS:

You will need 2 terminal windows to run twitter_console. Either open up a 'screen' session, or use tabbed terminals or something.

Terminal 1:
  Edit the userstream.php file and replace "username" and "password" near the end of the file with your Twitter credentials.
  Run the script thusly:
    php userstream.php

Terminal 2:
  Edit twitter_console.php and replace "username" and "password" in the 'defines' at the top of the file.
  Run the script thusly:
    php twitter_console.php
  Notes:
    Some terminal emulators do not respect the terminal escape sequence to auto-scroll a subsection of the terminal window.
    This can be fixed in one of two ways:
       i.  Run the script inside a 'screen' session (which I have found generally supports that sepcific escape sequence)
       ii. Add a do_tweet() handler to act like the other event handlers. The downside is that you will have to hardcode the number of rows in which the tweets will appear.


NOTES:
  By default the top sections take up 36 or so lines. If your window is smaller than this, the results are unexpected. Reduce your font-size.
  This client is not perfect, but it is working. It is for developers only right now since User Streams are in pre-alpha phase.
  I offer no support for twitter_console.

ENJOY!
